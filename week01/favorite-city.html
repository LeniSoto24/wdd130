    <h1>Favorite City</h1>
    <p>Tokyo, Japan's bustling capital, mixes the ultra-modern and the traditional, from neon-lit
        skyscrapers to historic temples. The opulent Shinto Meiji Shrine is known for its towering
        gate and surrounding forests. The Imperial Palace is located in the middle of large public
        gardens.
        The city's various museums offer exhibits ranging from classical art (at the Tokyo National
        Museum) to a reconstructed kabuki theater (at the Edo-Tokyo Museum).</p>
