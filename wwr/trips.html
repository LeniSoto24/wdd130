            <p>Here our last crew at the end of our traditional trip, happy and celebrating having
                completed a
                trip, apart from beautiful crystal clear water, full of beautiful views and the
                rapids, which are
                not few, and they found along the way.</p>
            <p>Leni's corridor is so loud that it drowns out everything except the sound of the
                water and your own
                breathing. From your seat on the raft, all you see ahead is a white wall, heaving
                and angry.</p>
            <p>Our fall trip screams pure adrenaline. As you can see, the raft is crashing into a
                powerful
                waterfall, and a client has been thrown while still holding the paddle. The water
                explodes
                everywhere and the raft tilts, showing how intense and unpredictable the river is.
